      <p>
        Currently, I am completing my second year of Computer Science BSc (Hons)
        degree at Teesside University. In my spare time, I enjoy working on a
        variety of projects. These projects help me apply and further my
        knowledge, giving me excellent hands-on experience outside of the
        classroom.

        Currently, the modules I am studying at university include working on
        algorithms, sorting functions and networking. I am available to complete
        any freelance work to allow me to put my skills into practice, please

        Outside of university, I enjoy working on various projects. One of my
        current hobbies is making/learning about web development. Some of my
        projects can be found below, I will be keeping this up to date as and
        when I complete projects.
