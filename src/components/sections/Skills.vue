    <h1>Skills</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout my education and commitment to furthering my knowledge at home
      I have built up a range of skills from 3D modelling to java programming.
      You can explore just some of the skills I have built up below.

      As well as the skills shown here, you can checkout the diffrent skills
      that i have picked up from the various modules <a href="#">Here</a>

        <h3>Java</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-details">
        <p>
          I have been interested and skilled at using Java from an early age. At
          13 I bought my first book on java, which taught me the foundations of
          what I know and use today. Since then I have continued to improve my
          knowledge and skills around Java. This has come in very useful as Java
          is the main core language that is taught on my university degree.

        <p>
          Across the summer holidays one year, I decided to complete a few
          different online courses on HTML and CSS, javascript, PHP and SQL.<br />
          One of the reasons why I am interested in and love web development so
          much is because of the speed at which functional applications can be
          developed. Websites can be developed for any purpose and there is a
          wide range of customisations that can be made to match the target
          audience. Websites are also one of the best distribution methods in
          todayâ€™s world as they can be accessed on all internet-connected
          devices.<br />
          You can find some of my web development projects in the list above.

        <h3>Photoshop</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-details">
        <p>
          At Secondary School creating graphical posters using an editor of our
          choice was a coursework assignment. I decided to use photoshop. Since
          then I have become very proficient with developing graphical images
          and logos. One of my main uses of photoshop at the moment is to plan
          and design web projects using the
          <a href="https://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a>
          , this is especially useful is you are planning on using bootstraps
          column system.
        </p>
        <p>
          As well as web design, I also use photoshop to create various logos
          and images, often using this alongside Lightroom to edit various
          images.
